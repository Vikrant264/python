    "                 - Python runs on many different platforms.\n",
    "                 - Python comes with a large standard library that includes many modules and functions for a wide variety\n",
    "                   of tasks.\n",
    "                 - Python is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed as soon as it is written,\n",

    "            Cons: \n",
    "                 - Python can be slower than some other programming languages.\n",
    "                 - Python is not well suited for mobile development.   \n",
    "                 - Python's dynamic typing can lead to some unexpected behavior, which can be confusing for beginners.     \n",
